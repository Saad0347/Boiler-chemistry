BOILER CHEMISTRY
Boiler chemistry is essential for maintaining efficient and safe boiler operations. Hereâ€™s an overview of the types of water used, basic chemical limits, and considerations to ensure smooth boiler functioning:
1. Types of Water Used in Boilers
Raw Water: Untreated water from natural sources, which usually contains impurities, minerals, and dissolved gases.
Make-Up Water: Additional water added to the boiler system to replace water lost due to steam production and leaks.
Feed Water: Water used in the boiler system that has typically been treated to remove impurities to prevent scale and corrosion.
Condensate Return: Recycled steam that has condensed back into water and returned to the boiler for reuse, saving energy and reducing the need for make-up water.
2. Boiler Water Treatment Basics
Softening: Reduces hardness caused by calcium and magnesium, which can cause scale buildup.
Deaeration: Removes dissolved gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide that can lead to corrosion.
Chemical Treatment: Adding chemicals (e.g., oxygen scavengers, pH adjusters, and anti-scaling agents) to control scale formation, corrosion, and maintain pH levels.
3. Key Parameters and Limits for Boiler Water
Maintaining these parameters within their limits ensures efficient and smooth boiler operation:
pH: Typically kept between 10-12 for water inside the boiler to prevent corrosion.
Conductivity: Low levels (specific to the boiler type) help avoid scale and maintain efficiency.
Dissolved Oxygen: Must be kept low, generally below 7 ppb, to avoid corrosion.
Hardness: Close to zero to prevent scale.
Total Dissolved Solids (TDS): Controlled through blowdown to prevent excessive concentration, which can lead to scaling and foaming.
4. Best Practices for Boiler Chemistry
Regular Testing and Monitoring: Frequent water testing helps maintain chemical levels within recommended ranges.
Routine Blowdown: Removes concentrated dissolved solids, preventing buildup and maintaining efficiency.
Proper Chemical Dosing: Adjust chemicals based on water testing results to achieve optimal balance.
5. Benefits of Maintaining Boiler Chemistry
Prevents Scale Formation: Reducing scale buildup improves heat transfer and reduces fuel costs.
Minimizes Corrosion: Proper treatment extends the life of the boiler system.
Improves Efficiency: Clean, treated water helps the boiler run smoothly, reducing fuel consumption and maintenance costs.
By following these boiler chemistry practices, you can help ensure smooth operation, reduce maintenance needs, and extend the life of the boiler system.
